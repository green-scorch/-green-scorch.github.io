**-Combat:** Monster mashing is the name of the game. A lot of spawns and managing hordes of horrors, fighting is key in order to survive
 
**Boss fight:** In order to win you need to defeat a specific boss. These are not necessarily the combat heavy maps. Some scenarios will throw a boss at you if you play poorly, but those wonâ€™t be included in this category.
 
**Investigative:** The focus is finding the key items, exploring the map, and resolving a sequence so the story unfolds. Most maps fit into this category.
 
**Social:** NPC-heavy scenarios that require deduction and influence. Little combat for the most part and lots of horror damage.
 
**Puzzle:** this scenario is a puzzle in disguise! The whole map will be a riddle, once solved, the scenario is beaten.
 
**Survival:** Just try to stay alive, this map is gonna throw stuff at you until you barely scrape by. You usually win by staying sane until then.
 
Also, as i was requested in the comments, and i think it's a neat idea, i'll give the scenarios a **"combat score"**, which is just how many monster spawns and combat difficulty you can expect from a given scenario. The scores will be:
 
**-1/5:** Little to no combat. Expect no monsters, just a few, or perhaps some at the end if you play poorly.  
**-2/5:** 2-3 monsters per scenario, just enough to break the pacing, but you can most likely ignore them.  
**-3/5:** Average spawns (4-5), one designated fighter will be enough to handle them.  
**-4/5:** Monster-heavy. Either because of bossing mechanics, or sheer volume of spawns, or importance of defeating them, more than one fighter recommended.  
**-5/5:** Grab your pitchforks. Specially difficult monsters or relentless assault.
